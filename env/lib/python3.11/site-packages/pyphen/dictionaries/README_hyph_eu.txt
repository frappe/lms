% Hyphenation patterns for Basque.

% as compiled by Julio Sanchez (jsanchez@gmv.es) on September 1991.

% Hyphenation patterns for Spanish.
% Compiled by Julio Sanchez (jsanchez@gmv.es) on September 1991.
% These patterns have been derived from "On Word Division in Spanish",
% Jos'e A. Ma~nas, Communications of the ACM, and implemented in his
% package ftc. You can get ftc and a draft of the abovementioned
% paper from goya.dit.upm.es in src/text.proc/ftc.Z. FTP access may
% be available. Otherwise, send help to info@goya.dit.upm.es for
% details on use of the mail server.
%
% Rules mentioned below are those described in that paper. After
% several unsatisfactory attempts to pretend I knew better, these 
% patterns closely follow that paper. Pattern 'tl' is not considered. 
% It is conflictive and ftc does not use it either.
%
% These patterns have been generated by shyphen.sh version 1.0, 
% shyphen.sh is a sh script that allows a number of choices. 
% Full benefit from some of these options can only be
% obtained if appropriate fonts are available.
%
% Follows a copyright notice. This is not in the public domain,
% but the copyright is essentially a hold-harmless clause. That
% is, use it at will, but don't sue me if you don't like it.

% Some of the patterns below represent combinations that never
% happen in Basque. Would they happen, they would be hyphenated
% according to the rules.

% This keeps {cat|lc}code changes, if any, local. Nice to users of
% multilingual versions. These are the minimum changes needed to process
% the patterns. These and other changes will have to be re-enacted when
% Basque be established as the current language. See the babel docs if
% you don't understand this.
